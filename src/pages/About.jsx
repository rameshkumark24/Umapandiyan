              <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-650">
                <p>I wasn’t born a coach. I was shaped into one — by life, by pain, and by relentless determination.</p>
                <p>As a child, I was called names that no child should hear — “dull-headed”, “dusky”, “unfit for anything.” I grew up hearing what I couldn’t do. But somewhere deep within, I knew I was more. I didn’t have anyone telling me that — I had to prove it to myself.</p>
                <p>I fought my way through labels and low expectations and went on to complete my Master’s degree. But the real tests came after that. Marriage brought with it many challenges — emotionally, physically, and financially. I faced unexpected storms — one of the most severe being retinal detachment in both eyes, I underwent surgery. But I didn’t stop there. I refused to live in darkness — both physically and emotionally. That was the turning point. I rebuilt. I healed. And more importantly, I learned how to guide others to heal themselves.</p>
                <p>Today, I am not just a certified life coach and healer — I am someone who has lived every shade of struggle — and found light on the other side. I’ve helped people rise above: Chronic health conditions, Broken relationships, Deep-rooted financial fears, Identity loss, Career blocks, Emotional and spiritual crises. If there’s one thing I know to be true, it’s this: You are not your situation. Your illness, your finances, your broken past — none of them can stop you when your inner "yes" is strong enough.</p>
                <p>This space — my coaching and healing — is not about motivation. It’s about transformation. It’s not about quick fixes. It’s about lasting shifts. And most importantly — it’s not theory. It’s truth, lived and tested.</p>
                <p>If you feel stuck, I’ve been there. If you’re tired of trying, I know the feeling. But if you’re willing to believe there’s another way — then I’m here to help you find it. Let’s begin.</p>
